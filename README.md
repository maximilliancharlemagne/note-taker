# Note Taker Web App
 
A note taking web app powered by Node and Express. The frontend was given as a template by the coding bootcamp this was a homework assignment for, I built the backend (app.js). Note (heh) that there is no live server supporting this application- to use it you, you will need to clone the repo, npm i the dependencies, and run the server by typing node app.js.
